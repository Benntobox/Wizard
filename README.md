# Wizard

# A simple text based version of the card game Wizard

# Each player is dealt a hand, bids on number of wins, then plays out rounds to win tricks
# Scoring is based on how close to the bid they guessed and the tricks won match
# Minor game logic errors and imput checks not valid, but game properly now runs
